				<h3>What is Hunger?</h3>
				<p>
				Hunger is the feeling that signals the body's need to be nourished. 
				In cases where the absence of food <br />is prolonged the term is used to describe the lack of food. 
				Concomitantly the word is used to describe <br />deprivation or poverty. Hunger begins when 
				certain nutrients begin to disappear from the blood.<br />A message is then sent to the part 
				of the brain that controls hunger, which reacts like a brake on the stomach and intestines. <br />
				As long as the blood is fed normally, this center of the brain delays the energy of the stomach and intestines. <br />
				When food is missing from the blood, the center reacts immediately and activates the stomach 
				and intestinal system, which works more intensively.</p>

			   Hunger in the World 
			   </h3>
			   <p>
			   A society cannot grow normally because of the vicious circle of poverty and hunger. 
			   To understand why this happens,<br/> we must begin our reasoning by observing the most sensitive part of the whole, which is the children.<br/>
			   Poverty and insufficient food supply not only create problems for the health and development of children,<br/>
			   but also contribute to the reproduction of unemployment and the perpetuation of poverty.
			   In developing countries,<br/> many children often have to help their families make a small income that will allow them to survive so 
			   that instead of going to school,<br/>they work in the fields, thus hindering education.
			   But even if children go to school while hungry, they face enormous difficulties<br/> in concentrating and assimilating knowledge.
			   Consequently,
			   hunger robs children of the right to acquire knowledge and skills,<br/> that is, to be educated. 
			   Continuing our reasoning, children who do not even have the basic knowledge of reading and writing,<br/>
			   it is very difficult in the future to find a job and almost impossible a well-paid job,
			   something that will help them get out of the poverty they experience.<br/>
			   The bottom line is that poverty and hunger lead to unemployment and vice versa, unemployment leads to hunger and poverty.<br/>
			   In other words, a vicious circle is created. Beyond that, if in a country there are only a small number of strong,<br/>
			   educated and healthy people who can work, it is very difficult for that country to build a strong economy.<br/>
			   Thus, when the population of a state is malnourished, productivity and wealth decrease. And the cycle continues
