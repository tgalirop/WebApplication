        <div><h3>Access to Education</h3>
	    <p>Education is the best weapon against poverty and hunger. It is 
	    especially powerful in underdeveloped countries.<br/> Education means 
	    better opportunity and more access to income and food. <br/>
	    Additionally, some countries have food-for-education programs 
	    where students are given free food for coming to school. <br/>
	    This may seem like a basic idea in some countries, but 
	    it is life saving in many under developed nations.</p>
		</div>
	  
	    <div><h3>Birth Control Education</h3>
		<p>High birthrates pose a problem when trying to solve hunger. 
		Many people are not educated on reproduction <br/>or do not have access 
		to contraceptives. Gaining access to contraceptives allows 
		for family planning and economic freedom.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div><h3>Sustainable Food</h3>
		<p>It would certainly be helpful for countries where there is hunger 
		to be able to produce their own, steady, supply of food,<br/> so that they do
		not depend solely on other countries (which in many cases causes debt).</p>
		</div>
		
		<div><h3>Government Intervention</h3>
		<p>Aid to foreign nations needs to be more focused on government intervention, 
		like programs that provide food to mothers<br/> and their children in poor areas. 
		This is not much different from many programs available in some countries.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div><h3>Social Change</h3>
		<p>This is extremely hard and will not take place overnight. However, many social issues, 
		such as war,<br/> pose a fundamental problem to halting world hunger. 
		Ideally, this will happen when world powers,<br/> choose to focus on solving these issues 
		instead of exacerbating them. However, this can only start <br/>when people in developed nations
		begin to care about those issues as well and pressure their governments to be productive in ending conflict.</p>
